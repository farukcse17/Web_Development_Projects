                Cox's Bazar is a city, fishing port, tourism centre, and district headquarters in Southeastern Bangladesh. It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower." Another old name was "Palongkee". Kutupalong refugee camp with more than a million Rohingya refugees is in Cox's Bazar.

The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India Company, a Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work, a market was established and named after him. It is one of Bangladesh's main tourist spots.
